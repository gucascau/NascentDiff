# NascentDiff

NascentDiff is a pipeline to conduct a differential expression analysis in genome-wide and RNA expression levels using ERCC normalization.

1. Quantitively comparing nascent transcription genome-wide changes at nucleotide-resolution for 45 pre-ribosomal RNA and whole genome under different condition
2  Measuring the global nascent RNA changes, including total nascent RNA, total rRNA, total protein coding and total long non-coding RNA.
3. Detecting the differential expression of various features of nascent RNA, including the 18S, 28S rRNA, non-coding RNA, protein coding RNA.
4. Meta RNAs Profiling for normalized EU-seq reads.
